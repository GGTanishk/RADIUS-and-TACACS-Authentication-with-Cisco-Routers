# RADIUS-and-TACACS+-Authentication-with-Cisco-Routers
This project would exhibit the skills required to authenticate Cisco routers with a RADIUS server, operating on Windows 2016 Datacenter Server, and a TACACS+ server, operating on a Ubuntu Desktop machine. 

The repository contains a well documented word file, which describes and summarizes the project thoroughly. It also consists screenshots, which would guide one to coomplete the project in a similar fashion.
The repository also has a picture, which gives the users a better understanding of the network topology used to finish the project.
